# EvoEpi
In this repository we provide the code and the minimum documentation that accompany our publication.
It provides an environment to simulate a simple branching process and SEIR epidemiological model including inhost branching process with bottleneck.

# Installation and run
To be able to reproduce or reuse our code, the following softwares are required:
## Requirement
- Python version 3.6 or higher
- Numpy
- Pandas
- Scipy
- Python-constraint
- multiprocess
- pp
To install all the requirements automatically via minicondo, simply type the following command:

    pip -r requirement.txt

## Run our code.

The code is organized in three main parts, all located in the folder src/

- The branching process: src/bp
- The analytical results :
- The epidemiological model: src/seir
